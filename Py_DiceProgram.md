Java_DiceProgram
    program simulates a dice where the user can roll with a random generated output of 1-6.
    The program also features a dice counter wherein the user can add or remove dices to their currently owned dice.
    If the user has 2 dices, then the random generated rolls turns to 2-12 to simulate the user having 2 dice.
    User can freely add or remove the amount of dices but the user can't have less than 1.
    The user also has access to "check dice" command which shows the current amount of dice the user has.
